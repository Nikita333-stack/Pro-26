The beef patty is a product of the long history of Jamaica, mixing pasties introduced by Cornish immigrants and cumin, curry and cayenne pepper introduced by Indian indentured labourers and African slaves who arrived to the country.[1] "The firecracker taste of the Scotch bonnet, a hot pepper indigenous to Jamaica, sealed the flavour."[1]

Jamaicans brought recipes for the patties northward in the 1960s and 1970s when many immigrated to the United States & Canada as hospital orderlies, home health aides and nurses.[1] The patties were then found in restaurants in areas of the New York metropolitan area with high West Indian populations. The patties are equally popular in British cities with large West Indian populations, such as Birmingham,[2] Manchester and London. Their popularity is spreading in the United Kingdom and they are becoming available in many mainstream outlets.[3][better source needed] They are also popular in Toronto, Montreal, Washington, D.C., and numerous other areas throughout the American northeast and Canadian Great Lakes regions; in many of those areas, they are available in grocery stores, delis, corner stores, and convenience stores. In recent years, the Jamaican meat patty has been pre-made and frozen for mass selling in Britain, Canada, and the United States. Jamaican Patties are also popular in the Philippines and it was launched around 2000s with various flavors such as Beef, Pork, Chicken & their latest is Tuna Jamaican Patty.
